# Introduction to Nonlinear Dynamics II Workspace

>Repository for Rachael's Nonlinear Dynamics work, Spring 2017.

This is where I will keep my homework, some notes, etc. for NLD2. See the repo
called "symmetrical-tribble" for last semester's things.

Just like last semester, I will probably be posting functions/modules that I write
for use in assignments etc. here, and they will (hopefully) be documented clearly.
The main reason I do so is for ease of use both during the assignment and in the
future. So if you find them useful, please feel free to use them!

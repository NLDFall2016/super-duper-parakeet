\maketitle

At the beginning of last semester, the ``about my interests'' paragraph
that I submitted talked about my interest in lexical knowledge, its
acquisition, and the implications for the structure of its
relationships. As a shorter-term application to my research, I discussed
my desire to learn how to apply dynamics to the graph-theoretical models
of ``the lexicon.'' My loftier if-I-could-make-any-dynamical-system goal
was to eventually model lexical acquisition with respect to the
relationships among the novel words and the existing words, as well as
the properties of the environment.

With these ideas in mind and now trying to plan a term project, two main
ideas seem most applicable. The first is to dynamically model spoken
word recognition using a \textbf{HEY FILL THIS IN ONCE THE NEXT SECTIONS

\subsection{Extending findings from graph theory in spoken word
recognition}\label{extending-findings-from-graph-theory-in-spoken-word-recognition}

This is some filler text while I write this to latex.
